This is a dynamic version of [Randall Munroe][1]'s xkcd webcomic [*"Unique Date"*][2].  
See it in action on https://voidptr.de/xkcd-1340 (updated at midnight UTC).

Use the bash script `today.sh` to generate a `today.png` with the current date (or set up a cronjob to do that).  
The script requires [ImageMagick][3] to combine the various image parts.

Artwork by [Randall Munroe][1], image chopping and bash scripting by [n.st][4].
